Wireless communication systems have changed the way of interaction throughout the world.
As antenna is a key component of any wireless device, it plays significant role in defining the
performance and characteristics of these devices. Therefore, the design of an antenna for
wireless system has become popular research topic among researchers and experts from
industries and universities.

Specifications of antennas usually involve many conflicting objectives related to directivity,
impedance matching, cross-polarization, and frequency range, gain, these can be formulated,
solved and analysed by using evolutionary optimization algorithms. Optimization Algorithms
shall be used for Parameter fine-tuning, Topology exploration and Radiation pattern shaping.
Evolutionary algorithms include Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, genetic algorithm,
Ant Colony optimization etc. In this project, we use PSO as the main algorithm to build the neural network model of the Antenna.
