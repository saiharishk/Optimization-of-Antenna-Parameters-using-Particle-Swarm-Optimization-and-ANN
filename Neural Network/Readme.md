The complete_pso_jian.m MATLAB file consists of the entire project code - i.e. from modelling the neural network to getting the output optimized parameters.

The data.m file is used for retrieving data from CST file and saving it.

We have used a sampling technique called Latin Hypercube Sampling to simulate the antenna such that the NN model created would be of least error - latin_hypercube_sampling.m.

nn_pso.m file consists of only creating a model using PSO.

my_func.m consists of the objective function for the NN_PSO.
